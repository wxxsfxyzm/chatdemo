# Gemini Android Client

This project is a third-party Android client for Gemini, based on API Token authentication. The
client is implemented using Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. The UI
widgets are built using the Google Material3 library.

## Current Progress

The following features have been implemented:

- Main interface and settings interface UI framework.
- Login and registration page navigation and UI construction.
- An example of handling network requests in a Jetpack Compose project.

## Future Work

- Connect with the server API.
- Establish a complete front-end and back-end communication.
